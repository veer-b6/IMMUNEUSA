                   <p>EA's Madden games provide a prediction of who is going to win the Super Bowl each year. The game has a super impressive track record of successfully predicting the outcome of the Super Bowl nine out of thirteen times. This is not a perfect prediction record, of course, but they did get fairly close to the actual scores of the game. They may, in fact, run better without any players taking part. Madden also touts one of the most accurate player ranking systems out there right now.

                   <p>Creator Hideo Kojima seemed to have some highly progressive ideas for his game series. Solid Snake is set in a world where there is a severe oil crisis where gasoline is scarce, with the entire nation fighting over the last vestiges. The game's solution is an algae that produces fuel as a byproduct. The algae, named Botryococcus braunii, created OILIX, as they produce high-quality petroleum after they photosynthesize.
