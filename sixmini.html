                   <p>Witcher’s Gwent might be the most addictive and engrossing strategy card game ever to grace an RPG. It’s beautifully balanced and enormously fun, with familiar characters and artwork from the world you’re exploring as Geralt of Rivia. You play as one of two opposing armies who combat each other with different cards and abilities.

                   </p>
                   
                 <p>
                   Playing Gwent adds a layer of depth to Witcher lore (it is mentioned in the original books), but it also serves as an entertaining game in its own right. Gwent eventually spawned a stand-alone game, but I prefer the elegant in-game version, which was quick to learn but offered enough depth to be tough to master.

                   <p>Wolfenstein wins the meta mini-game award with the wonderful nightmare sequences in The New Order and The Old Blood. If you choose to get 40 winks in certain choice locations, you'll trigger nightmare sequences for BJ Blazkowicz. These nightmares are some of the most unforgiving, classic Wolfenstein 3D levels, where you'll have to beat Nazis, attack dogs, SS troopers, and eventually big boss Hans Grösse. Fun fact: Wolfenstein 3D was the very first first-person shooter game!

                   <p>Looking to kill a little time in the local saloon has taught me just how easy it is to play until the sun comes up. I’ve played more poker in Red Dead Redemption than I have in real life, because it’s a beautifully realized mini-game that perfectly captures the thrills of no-limit Texas Hold 'Em. If you wear the elegant suit in the original game, you can deal yourself an extra card from the bottom of the deck, but you have to balance an arrow to prevent the other players from noticing that you’re cheating and throwing down. Sadly, Red Dead Redemption 2 ditched the cheating option.

                   <p>Things can get a little crazy in GTA, so having the option to work a side gig that helps you develop your driving skills and earn a little pocket money is handy. There’s something weirdly relaxing about ferrying people around the city streets in between mob hits and drug deals. The GTA series is packed with mini-games, with early titles allowing you to take on the role of a paramedic or firefighter, and more recent sequels offering impressively in-depth golf, bowling, tennis, and dart games. There’s even some soothing yoga in GTA V, but I still prefer to work as a cabbie when I want a break from the frenetic violence.

                   <p>Not many game series can match the epic scale of Final Fantasy, which is host to a multitude of mini-games. Two of the best are Blitzball and Triple Triad. Blitzball is a bizarre, complex, full-contact underwater sport that’s hugely popular in Final Fantasy X. Choose to play, and it’s easy to get obsessive about putting together the ultimate team to win tournaments.

                      Triple Triad is a strategic card game that first appeared in Final Fantasy VIII. It’s easy to grasp, but it takes a while to build a good deck, and there’s enough strategic depth to hook you. One of the other nice things about Triple Triad is that you can challenge almost any NPC in the world to a game.

                   <p>Orlog is a lot of fun. You roll and pick dice to unleash axe or arrow attacks, defend against them, or steal coins that can be spent on God’s Favors. These special abilities are applied at the end of each round and often change the outcome. You can find an Orlog player in most towns, and each one has a different God’s Favor you can win by beating them.
