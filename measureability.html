                   <p>Jigsaw puzzles are excellent for enabling you to engage your short-term memory. Your mind has to concentrate in order to sort out the different colours that form a picture. The more pieces there are, the more your brain has to work. Hence forcing it to think harder than it normally does. Solving jigsaw puzzles every day can help you improve your concentration a lot.
